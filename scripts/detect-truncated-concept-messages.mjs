/**
 * Truncated-concept-message detector (ADR-0103 Addendum 37).
 *
 * A customer's approved concept message can state a roster total in its own
 * header ("## Character List (28 players)") while the body below that header
 * only lists a fraction of that many names — the header line is written
 * first, before the model starts listing characters, so it still reflects
 * the ORIGINAL intended count even when the reply gets cut off mid-list by
 * hitting mystery-ai's max_tokens ceiling. That's a structural, deterministic
 * signal (no LLM judgment needed) that the concept generation was itself
 * truncated, independent of whatever `mystery_characters` count the package
 * ended up with — the existing roster-count-mismatch detector (ADR-0064)
 * only compares "approved" to "actual" and both can already reflect the same
 * truncated read, exactly as happened on Terminus 13 (approved parsed as 14,
 * actual delivered 15, stated header said 28 — the real gap only the header
 * comparison below would have caught).
 *
 * The root cause is now fixed at the source: mystery-ai retries once with a
 * continuation call whenever stop_reason is 'max_tokens' (2026-09-10). This
 * script is the backstop for messages already in the database from before
 * that fix, and for the rare reply that still truncates after the one bounded
 * continuation attempt.
 *
 * A truncated-looking header alone isn't enough to flag: "Death At The Velvet
 * Viper" has a stale 60-player approved snapshot that reads as truncated by
 * this same test (ends mid-item, "43. **Lucky/Lucia Fabron** –", parses to
 * 42) but the customer's delivered package correctly has 30 characters,
 * matching player_count. Even the delivered-count corroboration alone isn't
 * enough here — the header's stated 60 is itself stale, not a genuine target,
 * so comparing against it always shows a "gap" even on a correct delivery.
 * The actual reason this message never caused harm: its parsed count (42)
 * exceeds the same 35-character cap `scripts/detect-roster-mismatches.mjs`
 * documents production as using before falling through to a different
 * generation path (legacy scan / Claude fallback) — so production never
 * trusted this message's roster in the first place, unlike Terminus 13's
 * parse (14), comfortably inside that bound. This script reuses that same
 * cap for the same reason: outside it, the header/parse numbers were never
 * what production actually generated from, so a "gap" against them is noise.
 *
 * Re-parses each paid, completed package's approved concept snapshot with the
 * SHIPPED extractRosterFromMessage/extractStatedRosterCount — same technique
 * as scripts/detect-roster-mismatches.mjs: transpile the real source with
 * esbuild and run it, never a hand-copy (ADR-0057 discipline).
 *
 * ADR-0125: this used to slice the prelude out of
 * `mystery-webhook-trigger/index.ts` by two fragile text markers. Both
 * extractors now live in `supabase/functions/_shared/rosterExtraction.ts`,
 * shared by `mystery-webhook-trigger` and `extract-concept-roster` — this
 * script imports that file directly instead.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/detect-truncated-concept-messages.mjs [--since=ISO_DATE] [--json]
