const BUSINESS_BRIEF = `
SITE: mysterymaker.party — an AI tool that generates printable murder mystery party kits.
PRIMARY METRIC: qualified organic + AI-referral traffic that converts to package generations / paid.
MONEY PAGES: the generator/create flow, theme landing pages, and the blog hub (drives top-of-funnel).
PRIMARY BUYER QUERIES: "murder mystery party kit", "murder mystery generator", "murder mystery for N guests",
  "custom murder mystery party", "corporate/office murder mystery", "free murder mystery game".
LANGUAGES: 13 (en primary for this report unless a non-en query is clearly surging).
WHAT "AN ACTION" MEANS: a concrete on-page, linking, or content change shippable this week. The RIGHT
  action depends on the diagnosed lever (see LEVER DIAGNOSIS below) — an internal-link/authority push, a
  title/meta rewrite, a new/expanded page for a rising query, schema, or a blog post. Do not default to
  "title/meta rewrite"; that was the mistake three digests in a row (CHANGELOG 2026-07-27).

CANONICALIZED / CONSOLIDATED PAGES (do not recommend links or copy rewrites against these without checking):
- EN /custom-murder-mystery-party/ is rel=canonical → the homepage / (ADR-0046, 2026-07-27). GSC will keep
  reporting impressions/position for this URL for a while after the change (crawl lag), which can make it
  LOOK like a page worth linking to — it is not. If a quickWins item's rankingPage is this URL, retarget any
  "links" or "both" recommendation to the HOMEPAGE (/) instead, using the same query-matched anchor text.
  Never propose a title/meta rewrite for the custom page itself — it isn't meant to rank independently.
- Homepage title/meta is a settled decision, not an open lever: it already leads with "Custom Murder
  Mystery Party Kits in Minutes" and keeps the "| Mystery Maker" brand suffix per ADR-0024 and ADR-0046 §3
  ("no change needed or wanted"). Do not propose rewriting or A/B-testing the homepage title/meta — including
  brand-first variants — unless new evidence contradicts ADR-0046 specifically (not just a CTR-gap number,
  since the brand suffix's position within the title was already litigated there). The lever for homepage
  under-clicking on branded terms is authority/internal-links, not copy.

${BUSINESS_BRIEF}

LEVER DIAGNOSIS (the whole point — pick the right fix, not always copy):
Each snapshot quickWins[] item carries a diagnosed "lever" plus expectedCtr, ctrGap, and rankingPage.
Two independent axes decided it: CTR-vs-expected-for-its-position (a COPY/appeal signal) and rank band
(an AUTHORITY signal). Honor the verdict:
- lever "links": the page ranks on page 2 but its CTR is already normal for that rank — it cannot be
  clicked more without ranking higher. The action is INTERNAL LINKS / AUTHORITY, never a copy rewrite.
  Name rankingPage as the target, name 1–2 specific high-authority source pages that should link to it,
  and specify descriptive anchor text built from the target query. Do NOT propose a title/meta rewrite.
  The prompt MUST first verify each named source page doesn't already link to the target (fetch the
  source page and check for an existing <a>/markdown link to the target URL, in any anchor text) before
  adding one — if it already links there, say so and drop that source instead of adding a duplicate.
  This mirrors the copy-lever verification below; found missing 2026-09-14 when three of four link
  recommendations in one digest turned out to already exist live (CHANGELOG same date).
- lever "copy": the page ranks on page 1 but under-clicks for its position. Propose a title/meta rewrite —
  but the prompt MUST first verify (by fetching rankingPage) that the query isn't already in the title/H1;
  if it is, the lever is really authority, so say so instead of rewriting.
- lever "both": page 2 AND under-clicking — recommend the internal-link/authority push as the primary
  move and the copy rewrite as secondary.
- Trust ctrGap over instinct: a page-1 result with a large negative ctrGap IS a copy opportunity (copy can
  matter on page 1); a page-2 result with ctrGap near zero is NOT — it needs links.

HARD RULES:
- IGNORE obviously off-topic / spam / scraper queries (e.g. unrelated non-English prompt-injection
  strings, queries with nothing to do with murder mystery parties). Do not surface them as opportunities.
- IGNORE query-shape bot signals even when the topic is on-brand. Any quickWins/risingQueries item with
  suspiciousQueryShape: true has a literal quote character in the query text — real people essentially
  never type quote marks into a search box, and a CLUSTER of these sharing permuted quoted-phrase
  fragments (e.g. "guide to" + "murder mystery" + "x", or the same fragments suffixed "series"/"show")
  is a strong tell of scripted/bot query generation, not organic demand — confirmed 2026-08-10/11 when a cluster that
  looked like a surging, page-1, 0-click content opportunity turned out to be ~20 quote-permuted variants
  with zero clicks across every one. Do not propose a new page, section, or rewrite chasing a cluster
  dominated by suspiciousQueryShape items. If it's worth a line at all, mention it as "likely bot traffic,
  not a content opportunity" in Insights — never as an Action prompt.
- Never invent numbers. Use only what's in the snapshot. If a section has an error, say so briefly.
- Prefer 3 sharp actions over 10 vague ones. Rank by effort-to-impact (easy wins first).
- The action prompts are the product. Each must be complete and self-contained — include the exact
  target URL/query, the specific change, and the goal — so it can be pasted into a fresh Claude chat
  and executed with no extra context.
- NEVER write a literal HTML tag inside a <pre> action-prompt block (e.g. do not write <title> or
  <meta>). Say "title tag" / "meta description" in prose instead. A stray <title> in an email body
  makes clients treat the rest as document metadata and silently truncate everything after it.

OUTPUT: valid HTML for an email body (no <html>/<head>, just the body markup). Use this structure:
1. <h2>Scoreboard</h2> — a compact <table> of this week vs last week (organic clicks, impressions,
   avg position, GA4 sessions, AI-referral sessions). One sentence of plain-English "what moved and why it matters".
2. <h2>Insights</h2> — 3–6 <li> items, each a specific finding with the supporting number, ranked by traffic impact.
3. <h2>Action prompts</h2> — for each insight worth acting on, a numbered block with a copy-paste prompt
   inside a <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;background:#f4f1ea;padding:12px;border-radius:6px;">…</pre>.
   Order easy-wins first. Title each with the effort/impact AND the lever (e.g. "1. Quick win — internal
   links to rank X" or "2. Quick win — rewrite title for Y"), matching the diagnosed lever from the snapshot.
4. <h2>Site health</h2> — ONLY if the snapshot has a "siteHealth" block. Three short lines:
   (a) Dead internal links: report siteHealth.deadInternalLinks. This should be 0. If it is 0, say so plainly
       (e.g. "Dead internal links: 0 ✓"). If it is >0, this is a REGRESSION — show the count in bold red
       (<strong style="color:#b00;">), list the top deadLinkTargets (slug × linkedFrom), and add a matching
       action prompt to publish those drafts or remove the links.
   (b) Publish queue: "siteHealth.publishedEn live, siteHealth.draftsEn drafts remaining" — note if drafts are
       draining week-over-week (you won't have last week's number; just state the current standing).
   (c) Next up by link-graph importance: list siteHealth.nextUpByImportance (slug + importance) — the posts the
       daily cron will publish next (highest-value first, per ADR-0021).
   If siteHealth is absent or errored, omit this section entirely.
Keep it skimmable. No preamble before the first <h2>. No closing sign-off.

    prompt: `Check whether there is now enough PostHog data to attempt a "time from purchase to actual play" analysis for Mystery Maker, and if so, run a first pass.

Context (re-derive from ground truth, do not trust this note's framing alone): PostHog only started genuinely capturing production events on 2026-08-22 (ADR-0102, docs/adr/0102-posthog-key-missing-from-actual-deploy-pipeline.md) — before that date, VITE_POSTHOG_KEY was never wired into the site's actual GitHub Pages deploy pipeline (.github/workflows/deploy.yml), so posthog.init() silently no-op'd on every page load despite the client-side integration existing since 2026-04-24 (ADR-0100, superseded — its "4 months of lost history" framing was probably never real history to begin with). PostHog project id 569867 ("Mystery Maker"), events fired from src/lib/posthog.ts / src/lib/analytics.ts: \`$pageview\` (every route change) and \`package_tab_viewed\` (tab_name, conversation_id when available).

0. SAMPLE SIZE CHECK FIRST: query PostHog for the count of \`package_tab_viewed\` events with a non-null conversation_id, grouped by conversation_id, for events after 2026-08-22. How many distinct packages have ANY tab-view data at all? If it's a handful (under ~15-20), say so plainly and recommend waiting longer rather than drawing conclusions from too few packages — don't force a verdict out of thin data.
1. THE ACTUAL METHOD, if there's enough volume: for each package with tab-view events, join to Supabase's mystery_packages.purchase_date (or conversations table, check both — see the round-script-formats and payment-protection memory notes for which table is authoritative). For each package, look at the FULL set of tab-view/pageview timestamps across ALL its characters (not just one), not just the first one. The actual play-night signal is: do multiple distinct characters' pages get opened within a tight time window (e.g. same 1-3 hour block) with meaningful dwell time between events (not just a bounce), as opposed to scattered single visits over days? That clustering is the "this is when they actually sat down and played" signal, distinct from "the host poked around once right after purchase." Compute, for packages where a clear cluster exists: (purchase_date) to (start of the clustered play session) as the lag, in days.
2. SPOT-CHECK against two known ground-truth dates (both told to Jonathan directly on 2026-08-22, verify independently against the packages table rather than trusting this note):
   - Raleigh, "Camp Pine Shadow" — hosted Sat 2026-08-15, a full week BEFORE the PostHog fix. Expect ZERO PostHog data for this package. If there IS data, something is wrong with the date assumption above — flag it, don't explain it away.
   - Lyn, "The Cognitive Dissonance Incident: A Murder At The MSU Psychology Department Picnic" — guests were sent links same-day as the fix (2026-08-22). Check if there's a real, plausible clustered signal for this one; if the timing is too close to the fix's deploy time to tell, say so rather than forcing an answer.
3. Verdict: is there a usable purchase-to-play average yet, even a rough one from a small n? If under ~15-20 packages with real data, recommend re-running this same check again in another 3-4 weeks rather than publishing a number from too small a sample.`,

Re-derive everything from ground truth (Supabase, GSC, GA4, live site) — do not trust this note's dates or claims, they are priors only.

0. GROUND TRUTH ON WHAT WAS PUBLISHED: query Supabase blog_posts where slug='alternative-party-ideas-by-culture' — confirm which languages exist, their actual published_at timestamps, and status. Prior claims to verify: 12 locales (de, es, fr, it, pt, nl, da, sv, fi, ko, ja, zh-cn), published 2026-09-05 (de) to 2026-09-08 (the rest), all status='published', no 'en' row exists (by design).

1. INDEXING STATUS (primary goal — 2 weeks is enough time for this even if not for ranking): for each of the 12 locale URLs (https://www.mysterymaker.party/{lang}/blog/alternative-party-ideas-by-culture/), use the GSC URL Inspection API to check indexing status. Report how many of the 12 are indexed vs. not, and for any not indexed, what reason GSC gives (crawled-not-indexed, discovered-not-indexed, etc.).

2. INTERNAL LINKS CHECK: this post was inserted directly into Supabase, bypassing the normal daily-publish pipeline's apply-crosslinks.mjs step (which auto-links newly-published slugs from other posts per cross_link_map.json). Check whether alternative-party-ideas-by-culture actually has any inbound internal links from other blog posts in any locale — grep the live prerendered HTML of a sample of other posts per locale, or check cross_link_map.json for whether this slug appears as a link target anywhere. If it has zero or near-zero inbound internal links, flag that plainly as a likely reason for slow indexing/authority, and suggest 2-3 natural linking candidates per locale (e.g. that locale's "themed party ideas" or escape-room comparison post) rather than proposing a blanket fix.

3. EARLY SIGNAL (bonus, don't over-read into 2-3 weeks of data): pull GSC performance data (impressions/clicks/position) for each of the 12 URLs since publish. Also check GA4 for any sessions landing on these URLs, and note the traffic source (organic search, direct, referral — especially any AI-answer-engine referral pattern if that's tracked). Given the short window, frame any numbers as "too early to be conclusive" rather than a verdict — the goal here is confirming discovery is happening, not judging whether the content strategy worked.

4. VERDICT: is this series being discovered and indexed normally, or is something (missing internal links, a crawl issue, the rot-signal-style gate that gap-checks other locales) holding it back? If discovery looks fine, say so plainly and don't manufacture concern. If not, be specific about which locales and why.`,
