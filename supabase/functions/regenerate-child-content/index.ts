/**
 * regenerate-child-content — ADR-0051 layer 3: the child-content regenerator.
 *
 * This is the keystone ADR-0051 named: it turns the ADR-0053 completion gate's
 * "hold" into "self-heal", and gives the ADR-0047 auto-remediation worker a real
 * fix for the two classes it currently escalates untouched (identity_contamination,
 * slip_culprit_leak) plus the character-sourced half of meta_text_leak.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FUNCTION FROM regenerate-parent-content:
 * regenerate-parent-content (v6) re-runs the 4 HOST-facing Claude calls
 * (game_overview, materials, detective_script, evidence_cards) from master_context
 * alone — those fields don't reference other characters, so no cross-character
 * coherence risk exists. Character fields are the opposite: they are exactly
 * where identity contamination, slip-culprit leaks, and self-directed questions
 * live, because every field is generated with knowledge of every OTHER character
 * (via master_context.relationshipMatrix). Regenerating a character field blind —
 * without that same cross-character context and the same G-rule guardrails the
 * original Child scenario used — reintroduces the very defect being repaired.
 * This function exists to not do that.
 *
 * MIRROR-DRIFT WARNING (same trade-off regenerate-parent-content already carries):
 * the prompts below are mirrored from the Make "MM Live - Child (Unified)19"
 * blueprint (temp-files/MM Live - Child (Unified)19-SlipGuilt-OutputHygiene-
 * VictimQuestions.blueprint.json, modules 401/405/409 for detective-style,
 * 501/505/509/513/517 for character-style). If that blueprint's G-rules or
 * output_schema change, this file's PROMPT_GROUPS must be updated to match, or a
 * repair could reintroduce a defect the live generator no longer produces (or
 * fail to reproduce a new guardrail the live generator has). No automated sync
 * exists between the two — this comment (and ADR-0054) is the only tripwire.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
 *   1. Loads the package's master_context, mystery_style, extracted_characters
 *      (the original per-character seed description) and user_conversation
 *      (brainstorming fallback), plus every character row in the package (for
 *      cross-character coherence: names, roles, and — for the specific target
 *      character(s) — their OWN established fields as an anchor, so a field
 *      being regenerated doesn't contradict a field that's staying put).
 *   2. For an identity_contamination / slip_culprit_leak / meta_text_leak defect
 *      hint, auto-discovers every OTHER character also implicated by that same
 *      defect on this package (via the same ADR-0042/0041 detector RPCs
 *      auto-remediate-packages already uses) and regenerates all of them
 *      together — a single claimant fix often can't clear a 3+-claimant identity
 *      conflict, and a slip-culprit-leak fix needs every leaking character fixed
 *      before the package-level detector goes quiet.
 *   3. Calls Claude directly (mirroring the Child scenario's prompts, G-rules,
 *      and JSON-safety rules verbatim) per affected character, per "call group"
 *      (the same call boundaries the Make blueprint uses — description/
 *      background/relationships/secret/introduction together, rumors/
 *      accusations together, and the round-script bundle together). A call
 *      does NOT regenerate its whole group — the output_schema sent to Claude
 *      is filtered down to only the requested/effective fields within that
 *      group (`fieldsToGenerate = group.fields.filter(f =>
 *      effectiveFields.includes(f))`), and every field that IS generated is
 *      written; nothing extra is generated, and nothing generated is withheld.
 *      Cross-field coherence within a call — like "don't re-target a question
 *      at someone round 2 already asked" — is preserved only for whichever
 *      fields in the group were actually requested together in the same call;
 *      a request naming a single field in a group does not pull its
 *      groupmates along for that benefit.
 *   4. Writes back ONLY the whitelisted fields the caller asked for, through the
 *      SAME `remediation_read_field` / `remediation_write_field` accessors
 *      ADR-0047 built (jsonb-scalar handling for `relationships`; the rest
 *      plain text). This function cannot write a non-whitelisted column — the
 *      accessors enforce that independently of anything below.
 *   5. THE RE-DETECT GATE (mandatory, non-negotiable): re-runs the same
 *      detector RPCs before and after, for all four character-level classes
 *      (identity_conflicts, meta_text_leak, slip_culprit_leak,
 *      self_directed_questions) — not just the hinted one — so a fix can never
 *      be accepted if it silently introduces a DIFFERENT defect class while
 *      curing the targeted one. self_directed_questions is included because
 *      this function is whitelisted to write round2/3/4_questions, and
 *      ADR-0053's completion gate blocks on that class exactly as it does the
 *      other three. Accept only if every defect instance naming a touched
 *      character is gone and no new instance (for ANY of the four classes)
 *      appeared; otherwise revert every write byte-for-byte and report
 *      failure. This is the identical
 *      accept-or-revert invariant `auto-remediate-packages`'s `runGatedAttempt`
 *      enforces — re-implemented here rather than imported because this
 *      function's unit of repair is "N characters, M fields" rather than
 *      auto-remediate-packages's single deterministic edit, but the safety
 *      property (worst case degrades to today's escalate-to-human path, never
 *      "shipped something worse") is the same.
 *   6. Logs every attempt to `auto_remediation_log` (before-value, cost,
 *      outcome) — the same audit table ADR-0047 built — and honors a daily
 *      spend cap read from the SAME table, so this function and the periodic
 *      worker share one global ceiling rather than each getting their own.
 *
 * SCOPE (per the layer-3 task): this function is a standalone, directly-callable
 * primitive. It is NOT wired into the ADR-0053 gate's repair-in-loop or into the
 * ADR-0047 worker's escalate paths in this pass — see ADR-0054 for the exact
 * call contract those integrations will use.
 *
 * POST body:
 *   {
 *     package_id: string,               // required
 *     character_id: string,             // required — the primary/triggering character
 *     character_ids?: string[],         // optional extra characters to include explicitly
 *     fields: string[],                 // required — whitelisted character fields to regenerate
 *     defect_class_hint?: "identity_contamination" | "slip_culprit_leak" | "meta_text_leak",
 *     dry_run?: boolean,                // report the plan; call no Claude, write nothing, spend nothing
 *   }

</role>`;
}

function contentCoherenceRules(style: MysteryStyle): string {
  const base = `<content_coherence_rules>
These rules apply to every field you generate:
- LANGUAGE: This function has no explicit language parameter — write every field in the SAME language as the master context and this character's established fields (background/relationships/secret) below. If those are in a language other than English, your entire output must be too, including brief instructional asides (e.g. an accusations-phase reminder line) — never leave a sentence half-translated or a short aside in English while the surrounding field is in another language. (ADR-0112 addendum, 2026-08-29: this function is a separate re-implementation of per-character generation that never got an explicit language signal the way the main pipeline's mystery-webhook-trigger now has; this rule closes the same gap here at zero extra cost, using context already in this prompt, rather than adding another detection call.)
- CHARACTER IDENTITY: Write every field strictly as THIS character (the Character name above). NEVER claim another character's identity, kinship, or relationship to the victim (e.g. calling the victim 'my brother' when the master context assigns that relationship to a different character). NEVER give this character another character's secret, alibi, or guilty knowledge - in particular, the murderer's storyline and evidence trail must never bleed into any other character's scripts. Before writing any line where this character states their relationship to the victim, verify it against this character's OWN ESTABLISHED FIELDS (below) and the master context.
- TIMING: When a character refers to time, use approximate, event-relative phrasing ('just before nine', 'as the ceremony was about to begin', 'shortly after dinner') rather than exact clock times. Only give an exact minute if it is a deliberate clue AND you give the character a concrete reason they would remember that exact moment (they checked a watch, heard a clock chime). Do not build player-facing recall around minute-precise timelines.
- QUESTIONS: Every question in a character's 'questions to ask' list must be directed at a DIFFERENT, LIVING character. NEVER generate a question this character asks of themselves, and NEVER address a question to the victim (the victim is dead and not a player).
- ACCOMPLICE COHERENCE (only when this character's role is accomplice): their consistent goal is to PROTECT the murderer. They deflect suspicion away from the murderer and toward other suspects. NEVER script the accomplice to accuse, incriminate, or turn on the murderer in any round.
- BLACKMAIL / SECRET LOGIC: If a secret is being used to blackmail this character, that secret must still be genuinely hidden from the public — the harm is what WOULD happen if exposed. NEVER write that the same fact was already discovered or made public AND is still being used as active blackmail leverage.
- SECRET STAKES: Every secret must spell out the concrete consequences the character faces if exposed (ruin, arrest, loss of position, social destruction), and make clear this character will go to great lengths to keep it hidden.
- REAL-WORLD-SENSITIVE HARM THEMES: Do not write any character's secret, backstory, motive, or rumor around sexual assault, human trafficking, or the sexual exploitation/predation of minors or young women - whether this character is the perpetrator, an enabler, or someone who witnessed such harm and stayed silent about it. This applies regardless of the character's role (suspect, murderer, accomplice, victim). Other dark or adult themes (fraud, violence, addiction, affairs, blackmail over non-sexual misconduct) remain in scope and do not need to be softened.`;
  const slip = `
- SLIP-STYLE GUILT (culprit is drawn at the table — no character is guilty in advance): this character's static secret/background/description/introduction must give a MOTIVE or something-to-hide, NEVER a murder confession or guilty knowledge ('you killed X', 'you did it'). Guilt appears ONLY in the guilty-slip branch. In innocent branches and accusations, spread suspicion — never converge on one specific person as the murderer.`;
  return base + (style === "character" ? slip : "") + `
</content_coherence_rules>`;
}

const NO_CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT = `<no_chain_of_thought_in_output>
Never include phrases like "Wait, this is wrong", "Let me recalculate", "Actually, reviewing the matrix", "Disregard the above", "On second thought", "reviewing the relationship matrix", "looking again at..." in any output field. If you make a mistake mid-generation, silently rewrite the field cleanly. Do NOT show your reasoning or self-corrections. The relationships field is the highest-risk site — give it extra scrutiny before emitting.
</no_chain_of_thought_in_output>`;

const NO_META_TEXT = `<no_meta_text_in_output>
The output is what players READ. Do NOT include meta-instructions like "CRITICAL: Target 3 DIFFERENT characters" or "Pick a character from your relationship matrix" inside the field VALUES. Strip any "CRITICAL:", "Note:", "Pick a character from", "Target N characters", or similar instructional preambles from the field values. ALSO strip any bracketed authoring directions or placeholders that leak into player-facing values — e.g. '[choose someone with a strong motive]', '[insert name]', '[CLOSING PARAGRAPH — No Accomplice Beat…]'. These must NEVER appear in output; silently write the finished line instead.
</no_meta_text_in_output>`;

const CRITICAL_JSON_RULES = `<critical_json_rules>
1. Output a SINGLE valid JSON object. No markdown wrapper, no commentary before or after.
2. Use SINGLE QUOTES for any quoted text inside string values (dialogue, attributions, etc.). NEVER use unescaped double quotes inside string values — they break JSON parsing.
3. Apostrophes inside string values are PLAIN characters. DO NOT escape them with a backslash. Write \`That's\` not \`That\\'s\`. The sequence \\' is invalid JSON and breaks the parser. ONLY backslash escapes valid in JSON: \\", \\\\, \\n, \\t. Nothing else.
4. NEVER write '' (two apostrophes in a row) at the end of a quoted phrase.
5. Before emitting, scan every string value for: unescaped ", the sequence \\', and the sequence ''. Fix all three.
6. Verify the closing } and the final closing " on the last field are present and matched.
</critical_json_rules>`;

This character's role has ALREADY been established in the database — do not re-derive it. It is given below as "Established role". Write consistently with that role.
