/**
 * auto-remediate-packages — closed-loop auto-remediation worker. See ADR-0047.
 *
 * ADR-0042 gave us detection (read-only detectors + the 6-hourly health check
 * that opens a GitHub issue / emails the owner). Remediation stayed manual:
 * every live catch so far was found automatically but *fixed* only because the
 * owner was in the loop. This worker removes the owner from the loop for the
 * mechanical defect classes, and keeps a human gate exactly where judgment is
 * load-bearing.
 *
 * For each detector-flagged package in a bounded recent window it attempts a
 * class-specific fix, then RE-RUNS THAT DETECTOR and only accepts the fix if
 * the package now passes. That re-detect gate is the core safety invariant:
 * auto-remediation can never ship something worse than today's escalate-to-a-
 * human path, because the worst case *is* today's path.
 *
 *   Defect class                    Action
 *   ------------------------------  -----------------------------------------

 *                                   (prompt derived from the card DESCRIPTION)
 *   self_directed_questions         deterministic retarget to a living suspect
 *   template_artifact               strip the offending line; embedded
 *                                   (unstrippable) character-scope instances
 *                                   DELEGATE to regenerate-child-content

 *   identity_contamination          DELEGATE to regenerate-child-content
 *   slip_culprit_leak               DELEGATE to regenerate-child-content
 *
 * ADR-0061 (2026-08-02): identity_contamination and slip_culprit_leak used to
 * be escalate-only ("child-generated, judgment-heavy, no safe deterministic
 * fix and no child-content regenerator yet"). ADR-0054 built that regenerator;
 * this file now delegates to it for those two classes plus the character-scope
 * half of template_artifact/meta_text_leak that the deterministic strip below
 * refuses to touch. Delegation is direct (see delegateToRegenerator) — NOT
 * wrapped in runGatedAttempt, because regenerate-child-content already
 * re-detects and reverts internally; wrapping it would create a second,
 * independent revert path racing the first. See ADR-0061 for the full
 * rationale, the concurrency claim, and the shared-spend-cap reconciliation.
 *
 * Safety rails (all mandatory, all enforced below — do not weaken):
 *   1. Re-detect gate after EVERY fix; revert if feasible + escalate on failure.
 *      For delegated repairs, this gate lives inside regenerate-child-content
 *      itself (ADR-0054) rather than in runGatedAttempt — see above.
 *   2. Per-package/per-defect attempt cap (2), counted from auto_remediation_log,
 *      so the worker can never loop on something it cannot fix. Applies to
 *      delegated repairs too (the regenerator has no attempt memory of its own).
 *   3. Global daily spend cap, summed from auto_remediation_log; halt + escalate.
 *      Shared with regenerate-child-content via the same table (ADR-0054).
 *   4. Bounded window (30 days) so it never churns ancient/already-played packages.
 *   5. Every action logged with its before-value, so anything it did is
 *      reconstructable and recoverable by hand. For delegated repairs, the
 *      regenerator itself writes this row — the worker never double-logs.
 *   6. Concurrency claim (ADR-0061) around every delegated repair, so the new
 *      5-minute held-only sweep and the existing 4-hour full sweep can't both
 *      repair the same package at once.
 *
 * POST {} — or { dry_run: true } to detect and report the planned actions
 * without mutating anything or spending a cent (use this to eval it).
 * Optional { window_days: number } to narrow (never widen) the window.
 * Optional { only_needs_review: true } (ADR-0061) to restrict to packages
 * currently held in needs_review — used by the 5-minute held-only sweep.
 * Optional { classes: DefectClass[] } (ADR-0061) to restrict to a subset of
 * defect classes — also used by the held-only sweep, to avoid touching the
 * paid classes that don't need a tighter cadence.
