# Murder Mystery Party Generator — Claude Code Instructions

## Shorthand Commands

- **"sweep"** = Run a coherence sweep on a pasted purchase notification. Trigger: Jonathan pastes a purchase notification into a fresh session and says "sweep" — no other setup required, this file is auto-loaded. Branch on the notification's header/fields:

  **"New Purchase!" (a new mystery)** → New-Purchase Coherence Sweep (ADR-0103). Conversation ID is the only field actually needed.
  1. Resolve `package_id`/`mystery_style`/`player_count`/`has_accomplice`/language from the `conversation_id`.
  2. Note whether the package predates or postdates the 2026-08-11 blanket Sonnet 5 upgrade (ADR-0074) — pre-upgrade gets extra scrutiny, but don't skip post-upgrade.
  3. Run `list_packages_with_meta_text_leak`, `list_packages_with_victim_mismatch`, and `list_packages_with_unresolved_victim_name` scoped to this package — a clean result is a data point, not proof (all three have known blind spots, see ADR-0103; the third checks whether `master_context`'s victim name still contains "/" — a real regression only if the package predates ADR-0107's fix or the fix wasn't actually imported yet, since ADR-0107 deliberately didn't rewrite `master_context` on already-fixed historical packages).
  4. Manually cross-check the victim's name across `game_overview`, `detective_script`, and 3-4 characters' own background/relationships text. Any mismatch is high-severity by default.
  5. Read the full `detective_script` for leaked brackets/placeholders, garbled sentences, and — for slip-style (`mystery_style = 'character'`) games — confirm any `[MURDERER NAME]`-style bracket is the legitimate host-fill-in convention, not a leak.
  6. Spot-check 2-3 characters' full content (relationships, secrets, round scripts, accusations) for leaked authoring notes, self-directed questions, dangling references to removed characters, garbled text — **in the package's actual language**, not just English patterns.
  7. Run `package_completion_blocking_defects()` for genuinely missing content.
  8. Found something → fix it, re-verify, CHANGELOG entry + an addendum to **ADR-0103** (not ADR-0098 — different incident). Clean → report in chat only, no permanent document for a routine "nothing found."
  - Full checklist detail and rationale: `docs/adr/0103-new-purchase-coherence-sweep-ritual.md`.

  **"New 'Remove a Character' Purchase" (has a Batch ID field)** → Adaptation Batch Completion Sweep. Batch ID is the only field actually needed. No automated alert exists for this path (ADR-0088 deliberately deferred a cron here — paid packages, needs explicit sign-off before automating), so this manual sweep is currently the only thing that catches a partial batch failure.
  1. Query `mystery_adaptations` for every row with this `batch_id`, ordered by `batch_sequence`. Every row should be `status = 'verified'`. Any `'rolled_back'` or `'failed'` row is a real problem — the batch's own chain-dispatch guarantees it won't get stuck, but "didn't crash" isn't the same as "customer got what they paid for."
  2. For any non-`'verified'` row, read `error_message` and root-cause it before just retrying blindly — a rollback can be a false positive in the verify logic (like the 2026-08-28 sibling-batch-exclusion gap, ADR-0088 addendum) or a genuine unscrubbed content leak; only the former is safe to retry as-is.
  3. Cross-check current package state against what the customer actually paid for: character count in `mystery_characters` + `conversations.player_count` should both reflect every requested removal/reassignment actually landing, not just what the batch's own rows claim.
  4. If a row is stuck non-terminal, root cause fixed, and safe to retry: complete it directly — a new `$0`, pre-`'paid'` single-row `mystery_adaptations` batch + a direct call to `adapt-mystery-apply`, no second charge (the customer already paid for this as part of the original batch). Confirm zero verify issues on the retry.
  5. Found something → fix it, re-verify, CHANGELOG entry + an addendum to **ADR-0088** (the ADR that owns this feature's batching/verify design). Clean → report in chat only, no permanent document for a routine "nothing found."

## Changelog

After every meaningful code change, update `CHANGELOG.md` with a dated entry.

- Match the existing format: date headers (`## YYYY-MM-DD`), category prefixes (`### Fix:`, `### Feature:`, `### Improvement:`, `### UX:`, `### UI:`)
- Each entry: bold category prefix in the header, then bullet points explaining what changed and why
- If today's section doesn't exist yet, create it at the top (below the header)
- Don't duplicate entries — check if the change is already logged
- **Vault sync:** after updating `CHANGELOG.md`, append the same new entry to `/Users/jonathanmiller/Obsidian Vault/01_Projects/Mystery-Maker/changelog.md`

## Architecture Decision Records

When making a technical decision — new dependency, pattern change, API design, infrastructure choice, or deferring a significant feature — create an ADR in `docs/adr/`.

- Use the next sequential number: check the last file in `docs/adr/` and increment (`0013-`, `0014-`, etc.)
- Format: Title, Status, Date, Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives Considered, Consequences, Key files
- Include a **Discussion** section capturing key trade-offs debated and how the final decision was reached
- Use `docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` as a formatting reference
- **Vault sync:** after creating the ADR in `docs/adr/`, also write a copy to `/Users/jonathanmiller/Obsidian Vault/01_Projects/Mystery-Maker/decisions/adr-NNNN-slug.md` with this frontmatter prepended:
  ```
  ---
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  project: mystery-maker
  area: n/a
  type: adr
  tags: [adr, mystery-maker]
  status: open
  ---
  ```
  Status mapping: Accepted → `resolved`, Proposed/Deferred → `open`, Superseded → `superseded`. Add a `## Links` section at the bottom pointing to `[[01_Projects/Mystery-Maker]]`.

## Decision Tracking — Nothing Falls Through the Cracks

Every decision made during work — not just architectural ones — needs a durable home so we can reconstruct the trail. If you're making a call and can't say where it'll be findable in three months, write it down before continuing.

The routing:
- **Code change shipping behaviour** → `CHANGELOG.md` entry (see Changelog section above)
- **Architectural / pattern / dependency / API decision** → ADR in `docs/adr/` (see ADR section above)
- **Deferred work, known-but-unresolved issues, signals worth tracking** (e.g. "Pinterest pipeline broke around date X, 21 slugs need backfill") → vault note in `/Users/jonathanmiller/Obsidian Vault/00_INBOX/<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD-mystery-maker.md` with `status: open` frontmatter
- **Scope decisions during a task** ("we'll fix X but defer Y because Z") → captured in the same ADR/CHANGELOG entry that ships the X-fix. Don't let the "why we didn't do Y" reasoning live only in chat history
- **Operational follow-ups blocked on a date or external signal** → `/schedule` or a vault note with the date

If a decision doesn't fit any of these, default to a vault note in `00_INBOX/` with `status: open`. Better an over-captured note that gets pruned later than a decision that exists only in conversation context.

When closing a task, scan the conversation for decisions made and confirm each one landed in one of the above. If something didn't, capture it before moving on.

## Vault Integration

Obsidian vault for this project: `/Users/jonathanmiller/Obsidian Vault/01_Projects/Mystery-Maker/`

- ADRs and changelog entries are synced to vault per the rules above (automatic, part of the ADR/changelog workflow)
- Session-closing notes go to `00_INBOX/` as `session-YYYY-MM-DD-mystery-maker.md`
- Claude Code conversation history is auto-extracted nightly to `00_INBOX/` via `~/scripts/claude-extract-sync.sh`
  — run "process inbox" in Claude to create summaries and file them

## Model Upgrades — Check for Stale Hardcoded Models

Whenever a Claude model upgrade decision is made (e.g. the ADR-0074 blanket Sonnet 5 upgrade), it's easy to update the primary generation pipeline (Make.com blueprints) and miss standalone edge functions that hand-implement their own Anthropic call with their own hardcoded model string — they have no automated sync with the blueprints they mirror. ADR-0098 Addenda 7/8 found two of these (`regenerate-child-content`, `regenerate-parent-content`) still on Haiku weeks after the blanket upgrade, each also missing the `temperature`/`thinking`/`max_tokens` adjustments Sonnet 5 requires.

Before/after any model upgrade decision, run:
```
grep -rn "claude-haiku\|claude-sonnet\|claude-opus" supabase/functions/*/index.ts
```
Check every hit against the decision just made — deliberately-different models (e.g. a cheaper model for a narrow deterministic extraction task) are fine; anything that's just been forgotten isn't. This is a manual checklist, not automated tooling — deliberately kept that lightweight per the ADR-0098 discussion (the actual risk is bounded, doesn't warrant a shared-config refactor or a standing detector).

## Git Workflow

- After committing, always push to the remote branch
- Write concise commit messages that explain the "why" not the "what"
