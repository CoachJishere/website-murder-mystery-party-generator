          "answer": "Of course! Use our editor to refine and adjust your mystery until it's exactly right for your group. Change characters, themes, or complexity anytime."
        },
        "lastMinuteChanges": {
          "question": "What if I need to add or remove players at the last minute?",
          "answer": "No problem! Our flexible system allows you to adjust your player count even after creating your mystery. The AI will adapt the story and characters to accommodate these changes."
        },
        "whatIncluded": {
          "question": "What's included in my custom mystery package?",
          "answer": "Everything you need: a comprehensive host guide with step-by-step instructions, detailed character profiles for each player, clues, evidence, and all game materials. No additional preparation required."
        },
        "gameDuration": {
          "question": "How long does a typical game last?",
          "answer": "Most mysteries run 2-3 hours, but you control the pacing. Our host guide includes timing suggestions that you can adjust to fit your schedule."
        },
        "themedMysteries": {
          "question": "Do you offer themed mysteries for special occasions?",
          "answer": "We create any theme you can imagine! From classic 1920s speakeasies to space stations to fairy tale kingdoms - tell us your vision and we'll make it happen."
        },
        "ageRecommendation": {
          "question": "Is there an age recommendation for your mysteries?",
          "answer": "Our standard mysteries work great for adults and teens (13+). You can also request family-friendly themes when creating your mystery for younger players."
        },
        "freePreview": {
          "question": "What's included in the free preview?",
          "answer": "You can create unlimited mystery previews for free, including the basic story premise and character concepts. This lets you explore different ideas before purchasing."
        },
        "purchaseIncludes": {
          "question": "What do I get when I purchase a mystery?",
          "answer": "For $24.99, you receive everything needed to host: comprehensive host guide, detailed character profiles for each player, clues, evidence, and all game materials ready to use."
        },
        "refund": {
          "question": "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, contact us within 7 days and we'll issue a full refund, no questions asked."
        },
        "gameDesignEngagement": {
          "question": "How does your game design ensure everyone stays engaged?",
          "answer": "Our mysteries focus on rich character interactions rather than rigid storylines. Every character has detailed backgrounds and motivations that drive natural gameplay, ensuring all players stay actively involved throughout the entire experience."
        },
        "dynamicMurderer": {
          "question": "Why don't the clues point to one specific murderer from the start?",
          "answer": "The murderer is determined after the first round based on clues revealed during gameplay. This dynamic approach means clues build progressively, making the mystery solvable even if some details are missed in the party atmosphere. It's designed for real-world hosting where conversations flow naturally."
        },
        "flexiblePlayerCount": {
          "question": "What happens if someone can't make it last minute?",
          "answer": "Our flexible design accommodates last-minute changes! Since the game doesn't rely on one character holding critical information, you can adjust your player count without breaking the mystery. Life happens - sick guests, traffic delays - and your party continues seamlessly."
        },
        "characterFocused": {
          "question": "Why character-focused instead of plot-focused?",
          "answer": "Years of hosting taught us that overly specific clues get missed at parties - people chat, refill drinks, and enjoy themselves. Our character-driven approach means the mystery unfolds naturally through interactions, not through finding every single clue perfectly."
